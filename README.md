Hi, I’m @Cameron-Brown-Tech
I’m interested in Python, AI and all things computing, and data science related. 

I have recently completed a masters degree (MSc) in Financial Technology from The University of Strathclyde, and am currenlty a Data Science Intern at a Mutual Insurance company working on unsupervised ML Anomaly Detection tehniques. In partcilular Auto-Encoders.

I’m looking to continue immersing myself in the data science world as I believe in a future where we can harness data to improve all practices by erasing or exposing human bias.

Code displayed here is completely made by myself independently. 

Feel free to reach me on Browncg25 (at) gmail.com
I am open to all recruiting contact and will consider all positions.
