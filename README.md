Hi, Iâ€™m @Cameron-Brown-Tech

 Iâ€™m interested in HTML, Python, R and all things computing, and data science related. In particular web development as I am currenlty looking at building a website to host some projects.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python through my MSc in Fintech and a bit of HTML and CSS on the side
 Iâ€™m looking to continue immersing myself in the technology world. I have only been learning tech for the past 4 months but I am loving the challenge and exciting things that can be done. My dream would be to start in an entry level software engineering role upon completion of my MSc in early August 2022 as I am really enjoying the world of computing and software as there is always something new and innovative to do.

-            I am open to all recruiting contact and will consider all positions.
