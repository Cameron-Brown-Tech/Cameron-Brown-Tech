Hi, I’m @Cameron-Brown-Tech
I’m interested in Python, R and all things computing, and data science related. In particular with Natual Language Proccesing (NLP) as from past projects I have learned about its potential for furhter data analysis and wider AI opportunities such as fraud preventiion and equity research (Sentiment Analysis/ ESG analysis etc)
I’m currently learning Python and R through my MSc in Fintech
I’m looking to continue immersing myself in the data science world as I beleive in a future were we can harness data to improve all practices by earsing or exposing human bias. My dream would be to start in an entry level Data Science related role upon completion of my MSc in early August 2022, but I am open to starting in June 2022 as an intership while I working on my research projects.
Feel free to reach me on Browncg25 (at) gmail.com
I am open to all recruiting contact and will consider all positions.
