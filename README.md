Hi, I’m @Cameron-Brown-Tech
I’m interested in Python, R and all things computing, and data science related. In particular with Natural Language Processing (NLP) as from past projects I have visioned its potential for further data analysis and wider AI opportunities such as fraud prevention and equity research (Sentiment Analysis/ ESG analysis etc)


I’m looking to continue immersing myself in the data science world as I believe in a future where we can harness data to improve all practices by erasing or exposing human bias. 

Feel free to reach me on Browncg25 (at) gmail.com
I am open to all recruiting contact and will consider all positions.
